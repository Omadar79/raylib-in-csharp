## Raylib with C# Project
I love Raylib but when I use the c version I always get bogged down in creating features that I can faster in C#, 
I thought I could test the C# language wrapper for RayLib and make some sort of bullet-hell shooter. 

## Features
- **Twin Stick controls**: Simple to implement, difficult to fine-tune.
- **Bullet Hell**: I want to see how many bullets and enemies I can have on screen at once.  I'm not recreating an ECS architecture but I am trying to apply some ideas from that type of system by separating data from some systems.
- **Procedural Generation**:  I would put some level of procedural generation in every project if I could.  This is no exception, I want to procedurally generate the enemies and their attacks.  I like the idea of creativity view parameters and randomness.
