## Raylib with C# Project
I love Raylib but when I use the c version I always get bogged down in creating features that I can faster in C#, 
I thought I could test the C# language wrapper for RayLib and make some sort of bullet-hell shooter. 

## Features
- **Twin Stick controls**
- **Bullet Hell**: I want to see how many bullets and enemies I can have on screen at once.  I'm not recreating an ECS architecture but I am trying to apply some ideas from that type of system by seperating data from some systems.
- **Procedural Generation**
